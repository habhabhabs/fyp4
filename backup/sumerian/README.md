# Amazon Sumerian VR display interface for SIT@NYP Interactive Public Display
## Importing and Exporting
To export an Amazon Sumerian project: In Sumerian, open the scene that you wish to export out. Then press Ctrl + E on the keyboard to bring up the Export dialog. Export it as a Zip file and archive it somewhere (e.g. Git repository). The Zip file is known as a "bundle".

To import an Amazon Sumerian project: Create a new empty scene in Sumerian, and use the “Import Assets” button at the top and upload the .zip file through the “Import from Disk” option on the right.

After a few seconds, the scene contents should appear as a new pack in the “Assets” panel. Additionally, the contents of the exported scenes are merged into the “Entities” panel.
